HTML entities are special characters that are used in HTML documents,
to represent characters that have special meanings or cannot be easily typed on a keyboard. 
HTML entities are composed of an ampersand (&), followed by a unique code or name, and ending with a semicolon (;). 
They are used to ensure that these characters are displayed correctly in web browsers and do not interfere with the HTML code itself.

Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

1. `&lt;` - Represents the less-than sign ("<").
2. `&gt;` - Represents the greater-than sign (">").
3. `&amp;` - Represents the ampersand character ("&").
4. `&quot;` - Represents double quotation marks (").
5. `&apos;` - Represents single quotation marks (apostrophe, ').

These entities are especially important when you want to include these characters in your HTML code without causing parsing errors or unintended rendering in web browsers.

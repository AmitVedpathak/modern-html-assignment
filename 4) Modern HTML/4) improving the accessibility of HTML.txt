Improving the accessibility of HTML can be achieved through various techniques and practices. 

Here are three important ways to enhance HTML accessibility:

1. Semantic HTML : 
	Use semantic HTML elements to structure your web content. Semantic HTML elements provide meaning and context to the content, 
	making it easier for assistive technologies and users to understand the information. 
	Some examples of semantic HTML elements include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. 

2. Alternative Text for Images : 
	Provide descriptive and meaningful alternative text (alt text) for images using the `alt` attribute within the `<img>` element. 
	Alt text should convey the purpose or content of the image to users who cannot see it, such as those using screen readers. 
	Avoid using empty or decorative alt text (e.g., `alt=""`) unless the image has no functional or informative value.

3. Proper Document Structure : 
	Ensure that your HTML documents have a logical and well-organized structure. 
	Use heading elements (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to create a hierarchical outline of your content. 
	This helps screen reader users navigate through the page's structure and understand the relationships between different sections. 
	Additionally, use lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>`) for organized content, and ensure proper use of tables (`<table>`) with `<th>` elements for table headers and `<td>` elements for table data.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly improve the accessibility of your HTML content, 
making it more user-friendly for individuals with disabilities and ensuring compliance with accessibility standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
